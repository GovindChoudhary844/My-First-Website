            <h2>Industry Visits & Interface</h2>
            <p>Industrial visit has its own importance in a career of a student who is pursuing a professional degree. It is considered as a part of college curriculum, mainly seen in Engineering & Management courses. Objectives of industrial visit are to provide students an insight regarding internal working of companies. We know, theoretical knowledge is not enough for making a good professional career. With an aim to go beyond academics, industrial visit provides student a practical perspective on the world of work. It provides students with an opportunity to learn practically through interaction, working methods and employment practices. It gives them exposure to current work practices as opposed to possibly theoretical knowledge being taught at college. Industrial visits provide an excellent opportunity to interact with industries and know more about industrial environment. Industrial visits are arranged by ACEM, Faridabad with an objective of providing students functional opportunity in different sectors like IT, Manufacturing and services, finance and marketing. Industrial visit helps to combine theoretical knowledge with industrial knowledge. Industrial realities are opened to the students through industrial visits.<br>
              <br>  Industrial visit is considered as one of the tactical methods of teaching. The main reason behind this- it lets student know things practically through interaction, working methods and employment practices. Moreover, it gives exposure from industry point of view. They also provide students a good opportunity to gain full awareness about industrial practices. Through industrial visit students get awareness of new technologies. Technology development is a main factor, about which a students should have a good knowledge. Visiting different companies actually help students to build a good relationship with those companies. We know building relationship with companies always will help to gain a good job in future. After visiting an industry students can gain a combined knowledge about both theory and practical. The biggest advantage of such visit is that student gain a real world prospective from such visit, which joints them into a action and push them to plan there careers.</p><br>
